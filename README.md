Air Pollution Monitoring System using IoT

This project presents an Arduino-based air pollution monitoring system that leverages an analog sensor to assess air quality. The system displays the sensor reading on an LCD screen and categorizes it into air quality levels for easier interpretation. Additionally, it provides debugging information through serial communication.

Key Features:

Monitors air quality using an analog sensor (specific sensor model to be mentioned)
Displays air quality readings on a 16x2 LCD screen
Categorizes air quality based on sensor readings (thresholds to be adjusted based on sensor calibration)
Transmits sensor readings to the serial monitor for debugging (optional: can be used for logging or visualization)
Controls an output pin (pin8) based on air quality (optional: can be connected to an LED or buzzer for visual/audible alerts)
Hardware Components:

Arduino Uno or compatible microcontroller board
Liquid Crystal Display (LCD) module (16x2 in this example)
Analog air quality sensor (model and specifications to be listed)
Resistors (values depend on sensor requirements)
Jumper wires
(Optional) Breadboard (for prototyping)
Software:

Arduino IDE (Integrated Development Environment)
LiquidCrystal.h library (included in the Arduino IDE by default)
Getting Started:

Hardware Assembly:

Connect the LCD module, sensor, and other components to the Arduino board according to the specific wiring diagram (provide a link or image if available).
Ensure proper power supply for the Arduino and LCD.
Software Installation:

Download and install the Arduino IDE from https://www.arduino.cc/ if you haven't already.
Code Configuration:

Open the provided Arduino sketch file (air_pollution_monitoring.ino or similar name) in the Arduino IDE.
Important: Adjust the sensor reading thresholds in the if statements within the loop() function to accurately reflect the air quality levels for your chosen sensor. Refer to the sensor's datasheet or calibration guide for appropriate values.
Uploading the Code:

Connect your Arduino board to your computer using a USB cable.
Select the appropriate board and serial port in the Arduino IDE.
Upload the code to the Arduino board by clicking the "Upload" button (usually an arrow icon).
Running the System:

Power on the Arduino board.
The LCD screen will display the initial message "What is the air quality today?" followed by the sensor readings.
The serial monitor (accessible through the Arduino IDE) will display debug messages with sensor readings in parts per million (PPM).
The output pin (pin8) will be activated (indicating poor air quality) if the sensor reading exceeds the defined threshold. You can connect an LED or buzzer to this pin for visual/audible alerts (optional).
Further Development:

Calibrate the sensor according to the manufacturer's instructions for more accurate air quality readings.
Implement more comprehensive air quality categorization based on standard air quality indices (AQI).
Develop a web interface or mobile app to remotely monitor air quality data (requires additional hardware and software components).
