Air Pollution Monitoring System using IoT

This project implements an Internet of Things (IoT)-based system for monitoring air pollution. The system utilizes sensors to collect data on various air quality parameters and transmits them to a central platform for analysis and visualization.

Features:

Monitors air quality parameters like (replace with the specific ones you measured):
Carbon Monoxide (CO)
Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2)
Ozone (O3)
Particulate Matter (PM2.5 and/or PM10)
(Add others if applicable)
Employs sensors like (replace with the specific ones you used):
MQ-series sensors (e.g., MQ-7 for CO)
Other air quality sensors (specify models)
Transmits data to a central platform using (replace with your method):
Wi-Fi
Cellular network (specify)
Other communication protocol
Provides data visualization (if applicable):
Real-time readings on an LCD display
Web-based dashboard
